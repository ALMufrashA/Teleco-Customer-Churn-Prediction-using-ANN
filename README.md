# Teleco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ANN
# Project Description
The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify customers who are likely to leave the telecom service using their usage patterns and account information. By analyzing factors like contract type, monthly charges, internet service, and customer tenure, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained to predict churn with high accuracy. This helps telecom companies take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce revenue loss. The project uses Python for implementation, along with libraries such as pandas and NumPy for data processing, and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the ANN model.
